# Admin Dashboard for Real-Time Flight Status Updates

## Overview

This project is an admin dashboard designed to showcase real-time flight status updates. It allows administrators to manage flight information and automatically notify users about ticket creations and flight status updates. The notifications can be sent via email or SMS based on user preferences.

## Features

- **Real-Time Flight Status Updates:** Display current flight information on the dashboard.
- **Dynamic Data Management:** CRUD operations for flights, tickets, customers, and airports.
- **Automatic Notifications:**
  - **Ticket Creation:** Send an email or SMS to users when a new ticket is created.
  - **Flight Status Updates:** Notify customers via their preferred method (email or SMS) when the flight status changes, such as delays or cancellations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Bootstrap for styling
  - Axios for API requests

- **Backend:**
  - Flask
  - SQLAlchemy for database interactions
  - CORS for handling cross-origin requests
  - Flask-Migrate for database migrations

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
